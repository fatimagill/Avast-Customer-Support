If you prefer speaking directly with a customer support agent, Avast offers phone support. Although Avast does not openly display its phone number on the website, you can easily find the correct number by visiting the Avast website and selecting your country or region.

Here's how to contact Avast support by phone:

1. Visit the official Avast website.

- Any error codes or messages that have appeared

It's a good idea to prepare this information beforehand to ensure a quicker and more effective support session.

Email Support

If you're not in a hurry or prefer written communication, email support is an excellent option. Avast provides an email-based support system through which users can submit their questions or issues.

Here’s how to contact Avast support via email:

When submitting your issue via email, it's essential to include as much detail as possible. Providing relevant information such as product version, operating system, and screenshots of the problem will help the support team assist you more efficiently.

Be aware that email support responses may take longer compared to phone or live chat support, but it can be a good option if your issue is not urgent.

Before reaching out to Avast support, it's worth checking the Avast Help Center. The Help Center is a vast repository of articles, tutorials, FAQs, and troubleshooting guides that cover many common issues. Many users find solutions to their problems without having to contact support directly.
